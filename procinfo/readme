README for VMS::ProcInfo

This module lets you retrieve most of the info available via the system
service GETJPI, or the DCL lexical F$GETJPI.

perl Makefile.pl
mms
mms test

to build and test the extension. If it tests OK, then

mms install

to install it. More info is in the POD documentation in the ProcInfo.PM file.

VMS::ProcInfo allows Perl programs to retrieve info about individual
processes.  The information it returns is pretty much equivalent to DCL's
F$GETJPI function with two major differences. VMS::ProcInfo does not return
lists of info (rightslists or privileges, though the VMS::Priv module
allows you to see or alter privs), and will decode bitmap fields, which DCL
doesn't do.

This module can't violate VMS system security in any way that DCL can't, so
if you can see something with F$GETJPI, you can see it with VMS::ProcInfo.
If you can't in DCL, you can't here, either.
