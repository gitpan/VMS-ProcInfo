1.01  Thu Aug 21 09:40:05 1997
    - Now returning bitmap fields as longs.
    - Added support for quadwords.
    - Added code to return words for enumerated values (OTHER instead of0
      for Mode, for example)
      
1.02  Mon Aug 25 10:43:10 1997
    - Renamed get_single_info to get_one_proc_info_item and renamed
      get_all_info to get_all_proc_info_items. Longer names, but it makes
      their function more obvious, especially when this gets sub-classed by
      VMS::Process (some day in the far future)
    - Renamed secret mysto private hash item __ITERLIST to
      __PROC_INFO_ITERLIST so when this thing gets subclassed by
      VMS::Process, its provate iterator won't collide with any other
      classes that get subclassed.

1.03 Tue Aug 16 10:32:12 1997
    - Added decode_proc_info_bitmap function to take a bitmap and return a
      hashref with the bitmap decoded.
